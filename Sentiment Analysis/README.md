This folder consists of sentiment analysis performed using several algorithms. 
The purpose of this project is to implemented several machine learning and deep learning algorithms and compare the performances of them. 
The dataset used for this is disaster tweets that contain several tweets regarding hurricane, earthquakes etc. 
The dataset is provided as a whole and also splittted as train, test and validation set. 
The code also handles the labels by marking all disaster tweets as 1 and 0 otherwise. 
Exploratory Data Analysis has been performed and algorithms are implemented using scikit-learn and tensorflow. 
NLTK has been primarily used for Data Analysis and cleaning.
